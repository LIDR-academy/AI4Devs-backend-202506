This project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and an Express backend using Prisma as an ORM. The frontend is started with Create React App, and the backend is written in TypeScript.

## Explanation of Directories and Files

- `backend/`: Contains the server-side code written in Node.js.
  - `src/`: Contains the source code for the backend.
    - `index.ts`: The entry point for the backend server.
    - `application/`: Contains the application logic.
    - `domain/`: Contains the business logic.
    - `infrastructure/`: Contains code that communicates with the database.
    - `presentation/`: Contains code related to the presentation layer (such as controllers).
    - `routes/`: Contains the route definitions for the API.
    - `tests/`: Contains test files.
  - `prisma/`: Contains the Prisma schema file for ORM.
  - `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
- `frontend/`: Contains the client-side code written in React."
  - `src/`: Contains the source code for the frontend.
  - `public/`: Contains static files such as the HTML file and images.
  - `build/`: Contains the production-ready build of the frontend.
- `.env`: Contains the environment variables.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Contains the Docker Compose configuration to manage your application's services.
- `README.md`: This file contains information about the project and instructions on how to run it.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

### Frontend

The frontend is a React application, and its main files are located in the src directory. The public directory contains static assets, and the build directory contains the production build of the application.

### Backend

The backend is an Express application written in TypeScript. The src directory contains the source code, divided into several subdirectories:

- `application`: Contains the application logic.
- `domain`: Contains the domain models.
- `infrastructure`: Contains code related to the infrastructure.
- `presentation`: Contains code related to the presentation layer.
- `routes`: Contains the application routes.
- `tests`: Contains the application tests.

The `prisma` directory contains the Prisma schema.
